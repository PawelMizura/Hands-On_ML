# Hands-On_ML
This repository contains my implementations of tasks, exercises, and projects from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. It serves as a record of my learning and exploration of machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Aim of this Repository?
This repository is a way for me to document my progress and dive deep into the concepts and tools discussed in the book.

## Outline
The repository is organized chapter by chapter:

- **All Chapters**: Solutions to exercises found at the end of each chapter.
- **Chapter 2** (additionally): A detailed E2E Machine Learning project that closely follows the book’s guidance.

Each folder contains code, notes, and any required datasets.
